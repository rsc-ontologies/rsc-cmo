name: nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray-ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry
def: "A type of mass spectrometry involving multiple mass-selection steps, with some form of fragmentation occurring between each stage. The sample is ionised by forcing a solution of the sample through a small heated capillary into an electric field to produce a very fine mist of charged droplets (or by collision with solvent ions produced by the same process). In the first stage the ions are held in a stable orbit by an electric field generated by four parallel electrodes (a quadrupole). In the second stage the sample ions are accelerated to the same (known) kinetic energy and the time taken for each ion to reach a detector at a known distance is measured. This time is dependent on the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion." [rsc:hjb]

def: "A synthesis method that uses light to transfer a pattern to a substrate. A solution of photoresist (a polymer) is deposited on the substrate by spin coating. The photoresist-coated substrate is then heated to drive off excess solvent ('soft-baked', 'prebaked', 'post-application baked', PAB), typically at 90--100 deg. C. The photoresist is then exposed to a pattern of intense EUV (13.5 nm) light in a vacuum. A post-exposure bake (PEB) at 120--180 deg. C is performed before immersing the substrate in a 'developer' which removes excess photoresist. Positive photoresist becomes soluble in the developer when exposed; negative photoresist becomes insoluble in the developer. Finally the substrate is baked again ('hard-baked') to solidify the remaining photoresist." [rsc:hjb]

name: 29Si cross-polarisation magic angle spinning
def: "A type of NMR spectroscopy using a solid sample. Anisotropic interactions between nuclei, which are usually averaged by Brownian motion in liquid samples, cause significant line broadening in solid state NMR, but can be averaged to zero by spinning the sample very rapidly at the magic angle (54.74 deg. with respect to the direction of the magnetic field). Cross polarisation is used to enhance the signal from weakly coupled nuclei such as 29Si nuclei." [FIX:0001059, ISBN:0-19-855567-9]

The ions are then held in a stable orbit by an electric field generated by four parallel electrodes (a 'quadrupole') and accelerated to the same (known) kinetic energy and the time taken for each ion to reach a detector at a known distance is measured. This time is dependent on the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion." [rsc:hjb]

The sample is held in a matrix (such as crystallised dihydrobenzoic acid) to protect it from direct laser illumination and to separate the sample molecules. The ions are then characterised by two time-of-flight mass-to-charge analysers (where the ions are accelerated to the same (known) kinetic energy and the time taken for each ion to reach a detector at a known distance is measured) in sequence. The first isolates precursor ions of choice using a velocity filter, and the second detects the fragment ions." [rsc:hjb]

As the sample passes through a cell or cuvette it is illuminated with light in the region 190--1100 nm and any light transmitted through the sample is dispersed by the prism, so that light of different wavelengths falls on different diodes. The output from the array is used to construct an absorption spectrum that can be compared with standard spectra for identification purposes. Alternatively, a single diode can be used to monitor a specific wavelength at which there is maximum absorption." [rsc:hjb]

def: "A piece of apparatus, consisting of a light source, a hollow prism and a photoelectric cell that is used to detect non-ultraviolet-absorbing molecules in a sample separated by chromatography. Light from the sample passes through a flow cell with two channels towards the photoelectric cell. One channel holds the eluent from the column, whereas the other holds a control sample (solvent that has not passed through the column).  Detection occurs when the light is bent due to molecules eluting from the column, and this is read as a disparity between the two channels." [rsc:hjb]
